# STATISTICAL PARADOXES AND PUZZLES

```
Questions around different statistical puzzles are very common in interviews.

## [Birthday Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem)


In a set of n randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday. 
In a group of 23 people, the probability of a shared birthday exceeds 50%, 
while a group of 70 has a 99.9% chance of a shared birthday.

By the pigeonhole principle, the probability reaches 100% 
when the number of people reaches 367, since there are only 366 possible birthdays, 
including February 29.

## [Multiple Comparisons Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem)

The more inferences are made, the more likely erroneous inferences are to occur. 
```

 * Suppose the treatment is a new way of teaching writing to students, and the control is the standard way of teaching writing. 
Students in the two groups can be compared in terms of grammar, spelling, organization, content, and so on. As more attributes are compared, 
it becomes increasingly likely that the treatment and control groups will appear to differ on at least one attribute due to random sampling error alone.

* Suppose we consider the efficacy of a drug in terms of the reduction of any one of a number of disease symptoms. As more symptoms are considered, 
it becomes increasingly likely that the drug will appear to be an improvement over existing drugs in terms of at least one symptom.
